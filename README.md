## Version 1 features.

* Your pending tasks can be filtered. In this sense, we can focus on what remains to be done and be more efficient. As well as reviewing the completed activities and giving feedback.
* High privacy standards. Your data remains on your device, without sending or communicating with third-party servers. There is no control over your data as it is stored locally.
* You can remove items from the list with a nice little animation.
* There is no problem if you accidentally close the browser or decide to turn off the computer. We'd already thought about it, so we've got you covered.
